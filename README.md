# Tumblr Migrator

I was trying to move my primary blog to a secondary blog, and I figured it would be easier to simply migrate all of my likes and follows over to a new account using the API.
Sadly, there doesn't seem to be any programs out there that allow for this sort of thing, so I made one. It's in Java, using the Jumblr and ScribeJava libraries.
